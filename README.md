# Lucene Search Engine for Reuters' Articles

This application was created in order to test the Lucene libray for searching and indexing articles like a search engine would.
It was developed using the Java programming language on the Eclipse IDE. It can be easily imported and be run from there.
The Data.zip file contains the Reuters' articles that are to be searched and indexed. They should be moved into the Data folder
of the project before running it.
The application's UI is a simple command line (of the Eclipse IDE specifically).

The starting screen looks like this:
